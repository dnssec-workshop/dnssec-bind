This docker base image is used for further container by a DNSSEC workshop:
https://github.com/dnssec-workshop/dnssec-doc

This container runs a SSHd and named for easy testing DNSSEC.
It also ships some useful tools to check the DNS setup.

## How to use it directly
```
docker pull dape16/dnssec-bind
docker run --detach --dns=127.0.0.1 \
  --hostname=$CID --name=$CID dape16/dnssec-bind
```

## How to reuse it in your project
```
FROM dape16/dnssec-bind

EXPOSE  22 53
CMD     [ "/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", \
          "/etc/supervisor/conf.d/dnssec-bind.conf" ]
```

## Optional securing the VM
```
# Reconfigure sshd
RUN     rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
RUN     ssh-keygen -A
RUN     chmod 600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

# Set login data
RUN     echo 'root:root' | chpasswd

# Generate a new rndc key for BIND
RUN     rndc-confgen | \
          awk '/^key "rndc-key"/,/^};/ {print}' \
          > /etc/bind/rndc.key

# Startup services
EXPOSE  22 53
CMD     [ "/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", \
          "/etc/supervisor/conf.d/dnssec-bind.conf" ]
```
